# Menu-Buttons
This project demonstrates the implementation of a user interface (UI) using Unity's canvas system. It is designed as part of a learning exercise to familiarize with the Unity Engine's UI components and event handling. The main feature is a game menu with three buttons that allow the user to navigate through different scenes within a Unity game.

Features
- Main Menu: A starting point for game interaction with three primary buttons.
- Scene Navigation: Buttons that, when clicked, transport the user to distinct game scenes.
- Escape Key Integration: A built-in functionality to return to the menu using the "escape" key without the need to restart the game (only works on the Third Platformer Game).

Implementation
- Building UI elements using Unity's Canvas system.
- Programming UI elements for scene navigation.
- Event handling for button clicks.

The UI consists of three buttons for the three games that the user can play.
