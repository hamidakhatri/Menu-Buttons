# Menu-Buttons
This project demonstrates the implementation of a user interface (UI) using Unity's canvas system. It is designed as part of a learning exercise to familiarize with the Unity Engine's UI components and event handling. The main feature is a game menu with three buttons that allow the user to navigate through different scenes within a Unity game.
